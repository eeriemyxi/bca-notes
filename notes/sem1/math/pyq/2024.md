## Solutions
### **Section 1: Answer the following**

**a. Define Set.**

**Ans.** A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects that make up the set are called its elements or members.

---

**b. When is a matrix said to be singular?**

**Ans.** A square matrix is said to be **singular** if the value of its determinant is equal to zero. If the determinant is not zero, the matrix is called non-singular.

---

**c. Give an example of a bijective function.**

**Ans.** An example of a bijective function is \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) defined by \(f(x) = x + 1\). This function is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective).

---

**d. What is the Cardinality of the Set \(A=\{0, 1, -1, 8\}\)?**

**Ans.** The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set.
The set \(A = \{0, 1, -1, 8\}\) has 4 distinct elements.
Therefore, the cardinality of set A, denoted as \(|A|\), is 4.

---

**e. What is Sample Space?**

**Ans.** In probability theory, the **sample space** of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment. It is usually denoted by the symbol \(S\). For example, when tossing a coin, the sample space is \(S = \{\text{Heads, Tails}\}\).

---

**f. If the probability of an event A is \(P(A)=\frac{2}{3}\), then find \(P(\overline{A})\).**

**Ans.** We know that for any event A, the probability of its complement, \(\overline{A}\), is given by the formula:

\[ P(\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A) \]

Given, \(P(A) = \frac{2}{3}\).
Therefore,

\[ P(\overline{A}) = 1 - \frac{2}{3} \]

\[ P(\overline{A}) = \frac{3 - 2}{3} \]

\[ P(\overline{A}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

---

**g. State De Morgan's Law for two sets A and B.**

**Ans.** For any two sets A and B, De Morgan's Laws state:
1.  The complement of the union of the two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements:
    \( (A \cup B)' = A' \cap B' \)
2.  The complement of the intersection of the two sets is equal to the union of their complements:
    \( (A \cap B)' = A' \cup B' \)

---

**h. Find the values of \(x\) and \(y\) if:**

\[
\begin{bmatrix}x & 5 \\ 3 & -2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -8 & 5 \\ y & -2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

**Ans.** Two matrices are equal if and only if their corresponding elements are equal. By equating the corresponding elements of the given matrices, we get:

Comparing the element in the first row, first column:

\[ x = -8 \]

Comparing the element in the second row, first column:

\[ 3 = y \]

Thus, the values are \(x = -8\) and \(y = 3\).

### **Section 2: Answer any six from the following**

**a. Define injective and surjective functions with one example for each.**

**Ans.**

* **Injective Function (One-to-one):** A function \(f: A \rightarrow B\) is called injective if distinct elements in the domain \(A\) have distinct images in the codomain \(B\).
    Mathematically, for all \(a_1, a_2 \in A\), if \(f(a_1) = f(a_2)\), then \(a_1 = a_2\).

    * **Example:** The function \(f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\) defined by \(f(x) = x + 5\) is injective because if \(x_1 + 5 = x_2 + 5\), then \(x_1 = x_2\).

* **Surjective Function (Onto):** A function \(f: A \rightarrow B\) is called surjective if every element in the codomain \(B\) has at least one pre-image in the domain \(A\).
    Mathematically, for every \(y \in B\), there exists an \(x \in A\) such that \(f(x) = y\).

    * **Example:** The function \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) defined by \(f(x) = x - 3\) is surjective because for any real number \(y\), we can find \(x = y + 3\) such that \(f(x) = y\).

---

**b. If \(f:R \rightarrow R\) and \(g:R \rightarrow R\) are defined as \(f(x)=x^{2}\) and \(g(x)=x-3\), find \(f \circ g\) and \(g \circ f\).**

**Ans.**
Given functions are \(f(x)=x^{2}\) and \(g(x)=x-3\).

1.  **To find \(f \circ g\):**
    The composition \(f \circ g\) is defined as \(f(g(x))\).

    \[ (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) \]

    Substitute the expression for \(g(x)\):
    \[ = f(x-3) \]

    Now apply the function \(f\) to \((x-3)\):

    \[ = (x-3)^2 \]

    \[ = x^2 - 6x + 9 \]

    Therefore, \((f \circ g)(x) = x^2 - 6x + 9\).

2.  **To find \(g \circ f\):**
    The composition \(g \circ f\) is defined as \(g(f(x))\).

    \[ (g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) \]

    Substitute the expression for \(f(x)\):

    \[ = g(x^2) \]

    Now apply the function \(g\) to \(x^2\):

    \[ = x^2 - 3 \]

    Therefore, \((g \circ f)(x) = x^2 - 3\).

---

**c. Given the matrices \(A\) and \(B\), find the product \(A \cdot B\).**

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -3 \\ 5 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & -7 \\ 2 & -8 \end{bmatrix}
\]

**Ans.**
To find the product \(A \cdot B\), we multiply the rows of matrix \(A\) by the columns of matrix \(B\).

\[
A \cdot B = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -3 \\ 5 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 6 & -7 \\ 2 & -8 \end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
= \begin{bmatrix} (2)(6)+(-3)(2) & (2)(-7)+(-3)(-8) \\ (5)(6)+(4)(2) & (5)(-7)+(4)(-8) \end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
= \begin{bmatrix} 12-6 & -14+24 \\ 30+8 & -35-32 \end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
= \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 10 \\ 38 & -67 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Thus, the product \(A \cdot B\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 6 & 10 \\ 38 & -67 \end{bmatrix}\).

---

**d. Find the minor and co-factors of the elements 2 and 7 in the following matrix:**

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -4 & 5 \\ 3 & 1 & 7 \\ 0 & -1 & -2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

**Ans.**

**For the element 2 (position \(a_{11}\)):**

  * **Minor (\(M_{11}\)):** The minor is the determinant of the sub-matrix obtained by deleting the 1st row and 1st column.

    \[ M_{11} = \det \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 7 \\ -1 & -2 \end{bmatrix} = (1)(-2) - (7)(-1) = -2 + 7 = 5 \]

  * **Co-factor (\(C_{11}\)):** The co-factor is given by \(C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}\).

    \[ C_{11} = (-1)^{1+1} M_{11} = (1)(5) = 5 \]

**For the element 7 (position \(a_{23}\)):**

  * **Minor (\(M_{23}\)):** The minor is the determinant of the sub-matrix obtained by deleting the 2nd row and 3rd column.

    \[ M_{23} = \det \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -4 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} = (2)(-1) - (-4)(0) = -2 - 0 = -2 \]

  * **Co-factor (\(C_{23}\)):** The co-factor is given by \(C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}\).

    \[ C_{23} = (-1)^{2+3} M_{23} = (-1)^5(-2) = (-1)(-2) = 2 \]

---

**e. For any three non-empty sets A, B, and C, prove that \(A-(B \cup C)=(A-B) \cap (A-C)\).**

**Ans.**
To prove the equality, we will show that any element belonging to the left-hand side (LHS) also belongs to the right-hand side (RHS), and vice-versa.

Let \(x\) be an arbitrary element such that \(x \in A - (B \cup C)\).

\[ x \in A - (B \cup C) \iff x \in A \text{ and } x \notin (B \cup C) \quad \text{(by definition of set difference)} \]

\[ \iff x \in A \text{ and } (x \notin B \text{ and } x \notin C) \quad \text{(by definition of union)} \]

\[ \iff (x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B) \text{ and } (x \in A \text{ and } x \notin C) \quad \text{(Distributive law of logic)} \]

\[ \iff (x \in A-B) \text{ and } (x \in A-C) \quad \text{(by definition of set difference)} \]

\[ \iff x \in (A-B) \cap (A-C) \quad \text{(by definition of intersection)} \]

Since \(x \in A - (B \cup C) \iff x \in (A-B) \cap (A-C)\), the two sets are equal.
Hence, \(A-(B \cup C)=(A-B) \cap (A-C)\) is proved.

---

**f. Find the Trace of the matrix A:**

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 & 5 \\ 7 & 3 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
\]

**Ans.**
The **trace** of a square matrix is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal (from the upper left to the lower right).
The elements on the main diagonal of matrix A are -1, 4, and 6.

\[ \text{Trace}(A) = -1 + 4 + 6 \]

\[ \text{Trace}(A) = 9 \]

The trace of the matrix A is 9.

---

**g. If \(P(A)=\frac{2}{3}\), \(P(B)=\frac{3}{4}\), and \(P(A \cup B)=\frac{1}{2}\), find the value of \(P(A/B)\).**

**Ans.**
The formula for conditional probability is \(P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\).
First, we need to find \(P(A \cap B)\) using the addition rule of probability:

\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{4} - P(A \cap B) \]

\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \]

To add/subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 12.

\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{2 \times 4}{12} + \frac{3 \times 3}{12} - \frac{1 \times 6}{12} \]

\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{8 + 9 - 6}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \]

Now we can find \(P(A/B)\):

\[ P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{11/12}{3/4} = \frac{11}{12} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{11 \times 1}{3 \times 3} = \frac{11}{9} \]

**Note:** The result \(P(A/B) = 11/9\) is greater than 1. This indicates that the initial probability values given in the question are inconsistent, as a probability value can never exceed 1. For example, \(P(A \cap B)\) cannot be greater than \(P(A)\) or \(P(B)\), but here \(\frac{11}{12} > \frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{11}{12} > \frac{3}{4}\). However, the calculation based on the given numbers is as shown.

---

**h. Define a Partially Ordered Set (POSET).**

**Ans.**

A **Partially Ordered Set** (or **POSET**) consists of a non-empty set \(P\) together with a binary relation \(\preceq\) defined on \(P\), such that the relation satisfies the following three properties for all \(a, b, c \in P\):

1.  **Reflexivity:** \(a \preceq a\) (Every element is related to itself).
2.  **Antisymmetry:** If \(a \preceq b\) and \(b \preceq a\), then \(a = b\) (If two elements are related to each other, they must be the same element).
3.  **Transitivity:** If \(a \preceq b\) and \(b \preceq c\), then \(a \preceq c\) (If a is related to b, and b is related to c, then a is related to c).

The pair \((P, \preceq)\) is called a poset.

---

**i. Calculate the median from the following data:**
* \(x: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\)
* \(y: 8, 5, 6, 2, 1\)

**Ans.**
Here, \(x\) represents the observations and \(y\) represents their corresponding frequencies (\(f\)). To find the median, we first calculate the cumulative frequency (\(cf\)).

| \(x\) | Frequency (\(f\)) | Cumulative Frequency (\(cf\)) |
| :---: | :----------------: | :----------------------------: |
|   1   |         8          |               8                |
|   2   |         5          |            8 + 5 = 13            |
|   3   |         6          |           13 + 6 = 19            |
|   4   |         2          |           19 + 2 = 21            |
|   5   |         1          |           21 + 1 = 22            |

The total number of observations is \(N = \sum f = 22\).
Since \(N\) is an even number, the median is the average of the \(\left(\frac{N}{2}\right)^{th}\) and \(\left(\frac{N}{2} + 1\right)^{th}\) observations.

\[ \text{Median} = \frac{\left(\frac{22}{2}\right)^{th} \text{ obs} + \left(\frac{22}{2} + 1\right)^{th} \text{ obs}}{2} = \frac{11^{th} \text{ obs} + 12^{th} \text{ obs}}{2} \]

From the cumulative frequency table:
* Observations 1 to 8 have the value 1.
* Observations 9 to 13 have the value 2.
This means both the \(11^{th}\) and \(12^{th}\) observations fall in the group where \(x=2\).

\[ \text{Median} = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

The median of the data is **2**.

---

**j. What is the empirical relation between mean, median, and mode?**

**Ans.**
The empirical relationship between mean, median, and mode describes an approximate relationship between the three measures of central tendency for a unimodal distribution that is moderately skewed. The relation is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Mean} - \text{Mode} \approx 3 (\text{Mean} - \text{Median}) \]

This can be rearranged to express the mode in terms of the mean and median:

\[ \text{Mode} \approx 3 \times \text{Median} - 2 \times \text{Mean} \]

### **Section 3: Answer any four from the following**

**a. For any four non-empty sets A, B, S, and T, prove that \((A \times B) \cap (S \times T) = (A \cap S) \times (B \cap T)\).**

**Ans.**
To prove the set equality, we will show that an element \((x, y)\) belongs to the left-hand side (LHS) if and only if it belongs to the right-hand side (RHS).

Let \((x, y)\) be an arbitrary element of \((A \times B) \cap (S \times T)\).

\[ (x, y) \in (A \times B) \cap (S \times T) \]

By the definition of intersection of sets:

\[ \iff (x, y) \in (A \times B) \quad \text{and} \quad (x, y) \in (S \times T) \]

By the definition of the Cartesian product:

\[ \iff (x \in A \text{ and } y \in B) \quad \text{and} \quad (x \in S \text{ and } y \in T) \]

Rearranging the terms using the commutative and associative properties of logical 'and':

\[ \iff (x \in A \text{ and } x \in S) \quad \text{and} \quad (y \in B \text{ and } y \in T) \]

By the definition of intersection of sets:

\[ \iff x \in (A \cap S) \quad \text{and} \quad y \in (B \cap T) \]

By the definition of the Cartesian product:

\[ \iff (x, y) \in (A \cap S) \times (B \cap T) \]

Since an arbitrary element \((x, y)\) is in the LHS if and only if it is in the RHS, the two sets are equal.
**Hence, proved.**

---

**b. Using the principle of mathematical induction, prove that \(P(n) = 10^{n} + 3 \cdot 4^{n+2} + 5\) is divisible by 9 for all natural numbers \(n\).**

**Ans.**
Let the given statement be \(P(n)\): \(10^n + 3 \cdot 4^{n+2} + 5\) is divisible by 9.

**Step 1: Base Case**
For \(n=1\), we have:

\[ P(1) = 10^1 + 3 \cdot 4^{1+2} + 5 \]

\[ = 10 + 3 \cdot 4^3 + 5 \]

\[ = 10 + 3 \cdot 64 + 5 \]

\[ = 10 + 192 + 5 = 207 \]

Since \(207 = 9 \times 23\), \(P(1)\) is divisible by 9. Thus, the base case is true.

**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**
Let us assume that \(P(k)\) is true for some natural number \(k\).
That is, \(10^k + 3 \cdot 4^{k+2} + 5\) is divisible by 9.
We can write this as \(10^k + 3 \cdot 4^{k+2} + 5 = 9m\) for some integer \(m\).

\[ \implies 10^k = 9m - 3 \cdot 4^{k+2} - 5 \quad \dots(i) \]

**Step 3: Inductive Step**
We need to prove that \(P(k+1)\) is also true.

\[ P(k+1) = 10^{k+1} + 3 \cdot 4^{(k+1)+2} + 5 \]

\[ = 10^{k+1} + 3 \cdot 4^{k+3} + 5 \]

\[ = 10 \cdot 10^k + 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 4^{k+2} + 5 \]

\[ = 10 \cdot 10^k + 12 \cdot 4^{k+2} + 5 \]

Substituting the value of \(10^k\) from equation (i):

\[ = 10 (9m - 3 \cdot 4^{k+2} - 5) + 12 \cdot 4^{k+2} + 5 \]

\[ = 90m - 30 \cdot 4^{k+2} - 50 + 12 \cdot 4^{k+2} + 5 \]

\[ = 90m - (30 - 12) \cdot 4^{k+2} - 45 \]

\[ = 90m - 18 \cdot 4^{k+2} - 45 \]

Factoring out 9 from each term:

\[ = 9 (10m - 2 \cdot 4^{k+2} - 5) \]

Since \(m\) and \(k\) are integers, \((10m - 2 \cdot 4^{k+2} - 5)\) is also an integer.
Thus, \(P(k+1)\) is a multiple of 9.

By the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all natural numbers \(n\).
**Hence, proved.**

| \(f_i\) | 8 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 6 |

**Ans.**
**Step 1: Calculate the Median**
First, we find the cumulative frequency (\(cf\)) to locate the median.

| \(x_i\) | Frequency (\(f_i\)) | Cumulative Frequency (\(cf\)) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|   5   |   8   |   8   |
|   7   |   6   |  14   |
|   9   |   2   |  16   |
|   10  |   2   |  18   |
|   12  |   6   |  24   |
|   15  |   6   |  30   |

The total frequency is \(N = \sum f_i = 30\).
Since \(N\) is even, the median is the average of the \(\left(\frac{N}{2}\right)^{th}\) and \(\left(\frac{N}{2} + 1\right)^{th}\) observations.
This corresponds to the average of the \(15^{th}\) and \(16^{th}\) observations.
From the \(cf\) column, the \(15^{th}\) and \(16^{th}\) observations both fall in the group where \(x_i = 9\).
So, Median \(M = 9\).

**Step 2: Calculate Mean Deviation about the Median**
The formula is \(MD_M = \frac{\sum f_i |x_i - M|}{N}\). We create a calculation table:

| \(x_i\) | \(f_i\) | \(|x_i - M| = |x_i - 9|\) | \(f_i |x_i - M|\) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|   5   |   8   |   4   |  32   |
|   7   |   6   |   2   |  12   |
|   9   |   2   |   0   |   0   |
|   10  |   2   |   1   |   2   |
|   12  |   6   |   3   |  18   |
|   15  |   6   |   6   |  36   |
| **Total** | **\(N=30\)** | | **\(\sum f_i |x_i - M| = 100\)** |

Now, we compute the mean deviation:

\[ MD_M = \frac{100}{30} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

The mean deviation about the median is approximately **3.33**.

**f. Solve the following system of linear equations using Cramer's rule:**

\[
\begin{cases}
2x - y + 3z = 9 \\
x + y + z = 6 \\
x - y + z = 2
\end{cases}
\]

**Ans.**
The given system of equations can be written in matrix form \(AX=B\), where:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad X = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 9 \\ 6 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \]

**Step 1: Calculate the determinant D of the coefficient matrix A.**

\[ D = \det(A) = \begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 \end{vmatrix} \]

\[ = 2(1\cdot1 - 1\cdot(-1)) - (-1)(1\cdot1 - 1\cdot1) + 3(1\cdot(-1) - 1\cdot1) \]

\[ = 2(2) + 1(0) + 3(-2) = 4 - 6 = -2 \]

Since \(D \neq 0\), a unique solution exists.

**Step 2: Calculate \(D_x\), \(D_y\), and \(D_z\).**

\[ D_x = \begin{vmatrix} 9 & -1 & 3 \\ 6 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 & -1 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = 9(1 - (-1)) - (-1)(6-2) + 3(-6-2) = 18+4-24 = -2 \]

\[ D_y = \begin{vmatrix} 2 & 9 & 3 \\ 1 & 6 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = 2(6 - 2) - 9(1-1) + 3(2-6) = 8-0-12 = -4 \]

\[ D_z = \begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 & 9 \\ 1 & 1 & 6 \\ 1 & -1 & 2 \end{vmatrix} = 2(2 - (-6)) - (-1)(2-6) + 9(-1-1) = 16-4-18 = -6 \]

**Step 3: Find x, y, and z.**
According to Cramer's rule:

\[ x = \frac{D_x}{D} = \frac{-2}{-2} = 1 \]

\[ y = \frac{D_y}{D} = \frac{-4}{-2} = 2 \]

\[ z = \frac{D_z}{D} = \frac{-6}{-2} = 3 \]

The solution is \(x=1, y=2, z=3\).

**g. Find the inverse of the matrix A:**

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

**Ans.**
We will use the formula \(A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\text{adj}(A)\).

**Step 1: Find the determinant of A.**

\[ \det(A) = 0(2\cdot1 - 3\cdot1) - 1(1\cdot1 - 3\cdot3) + 2(1\cdot1 - 2\cdot3) \]

\[ = 0 - 1(1-9) + 2(1-6) = -1(-8) + 2(-5) = 8 - 10 = -2 \]

Since \(\det(A) \neq 0\), the inverse exists.

**Step 2: Find the Adjoint of A.**
The adjoint is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. Let's find the cofactors:

\[ C_{11} = (2\cdot1 - 3\cdot1) = -1 \]

\[ C_{12} = -(1\cdot1 - 3\cdot3) = 8 \]

\[ C_{13} = (1\cdot1 - 2\cdot3) = -5 \]

\[ C_{21} = -(1\cdot1 - 2\cdot1) = 1 \]

\[ C_{22} = (0\cdot1 - 2\cdot3) = -6 \]

\[ C_{23} = -(0\cdot1 - 1\cdot3) = 3 \]

\[ C_{31} = (1\cdot3 - 2\cdot2) = -1 \]

\[ C_{32} = -(0\cdot3 - 2\cdot1) = 2 \]

\[ C_{33} = (0\cdot2 - 1\cdot1) = -1 \]

The cofactor matrix is \(C = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 8 & -5 \\ 1 & -6 & 3 \\ -1 & 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\).
The adjoint of A is the transpose of C:

\[ \text{adj}(A) = C^T = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & -1 \\ 8 & -6 & 2 \\ -5 & 3 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the inverse.**

\[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{-2} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & -1 \\ 8 & -6 & 2 \\ -5 & 3 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \]

\[ A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & -1/2 & 1/2 \\ -4 & 3 & -1 \\ 5/2 & -3/2 & 1/2 \end{bmatrix} \]

This is the required inverse matrix.
