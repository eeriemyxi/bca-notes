# Sets
### Definition of a Set

In mathematics, a **set** is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects that make up a set are called its **elements** or **members**. The key characteristics of a set are:

-   **Well-defined:** It must be clear and unambiguous whether an object belongs to the set or not. For example, "the set of tall students in a class" is not well-defined because "tall" is subjective. However, "the set of students in a class taller than 170 cm" is well-defined.
-   **Distinct:** A set does not contain duplicate elements. Each element is unique.
-   **Unordered:** The order in which elements are listed does not matter. The set \(\{a, b, c\}\) is the same as \(\{c, a, b\}\).

!!! note "Notation"
    - Sets are usually denoted by capital letters (e.g., \(A, B, S\)).
    - Elements are usually denoted by lowercase letters (e.g., \(a, b, x\)).
    - If \(x\) is an element of a set \(A\), we write \(x \in A\) (read as "x belongs to A").
    - If \(x\) is not an element of a set \(A\), we write \(x \notin A\) (read as "x does not belong to A").

#### Representation of Sets

There are two primary ways to represent a set:

1.  **Roster or Tabular Form:**
    All the elements of the set are listed, separated by commas and enclosed within curly braces \(\{\}\).

    !!! example "Roster Form"
        - The set \(V\) of vowels in the English alphabet: \(V = \{a, e, i, o, u\}\)
        - The set \(N\) of the first 5 natural numbers: \(N = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)
        - The set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\): \(\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}\)

2.  **Set-Builder or Rule Form:**
    A set is described by stating a property that its elements must satisfy. The general form is \(A = \{x \mid P(x)\}\) or \(A = \{x : P(x)\}\), which is read as "the set of all elements \(x\) such that \(x\) satisfies the property \(P(x)\)".

    !!! example "Set-Builder Form"
        - The set \(V\) of vowels in the English alphabet: \(V = \{x \mid x \text{ is a vowel in the English alphabet}\}\)
        - The set \(E\) of all even integers: \(E = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } x = 2k \text{ for some integer } k\}\)
        - The set \(Q\) of rational numbers: \(Q = \{x \mid x = p/q, \text{ where } p, q \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } q \neq 0\}\)

#### Important Sets in Mathematics

-   \(\emptyset\) or \(\{\}\): The **empty set** or **null set**, which contains no elements.
-   \(\mathbb{N}\): The set of **Natural Numbers** \(\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}\).
-   \(\mathbb{W}\): The set of **Whole Numbers** \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}\).
-   \(\mathbb{Z}\): The set of **Integers** \(\{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots\}\).
-   \(\mathbb{Q}\): The set of **Rational Numbers** (fractions).
-   \(\mathbb{R}\): The set of **Real Numbers** (includes all rational and irrational numbers).
-   \(\mathbb{C}\): The set of **Complex Numbers**.

### Cardinality of a Set

The **cardinality** of a set is a measure of the "number of elements" of the set. For a finite set, the cardinality is simply the count of its elements.

!!! note "Notation"
    The cardinality of a set \(A\) is denoted by \(|A|\), \(n(A)\), or \(card(A)\).

!!! example "Cardinality"
    - If \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\), then \(|A| = 4\).
    - If \(V = \{a, e, i, o, u\}\), then \(|V| = 5\).
    - For the empty set, \(|\emptyset| = 0\).
    - For the set \(B = \{a, b, \{c, d\}\}\), \(|B| = 3\). The elements are \(a\), \(b\), and the set \(\{c, d\}\).

### Classification of Sets

Based on their cardinality, sets can be classified into finite, countable, and infinite.


#### Finite Sets

A set is called **finite** if it is either empty or contains a specific, countable number of elements. In other words, if the process of counting its elements can eventually come to an end.

Formally, a set \(S\) is finite if there exists a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) between its elements and the set \(\{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}\) for some non-negative integer \(n\). The cardinality of such a set is \(|S| = n\).

!!! example "Finite Sets"
    - The set of days in a week: \(|\{\text{Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat}\}| = 7\).
    - The set of students in your classroom.
    - The set of all prime numbers less than 100.

#### Infinite Sets

A set that is not finite is called an **infinite set**. The process of counting its elements would never end.

!!! example "Infinite Sets"
    - The set of natural numbers \(\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}\).
    - The set of all points on a line.
    - The set of real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\).

Infinite sets can be further divided into two categories: countable and uncountable.

#### Countable Sets

A set is **countable** if its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers \(\mathbb{N}\). This essentially means we can "list" all the elements of the set in a sequence \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots\), even if the list goes on forever.

-   **All finite sets are countable.**
-   An infinite set that is countable is called **countably infinite** or **denumerable**.

The cardinality of a countably infinite set is denoted by the symbol \(\aleph_0\) (aleph-null). Thus, \(|\mathbb{N}| = \aleph_0\).

!!! info "Key Countably Infinite Sets"
    -   **The Set of Natural Numbers (\(\mathbb{N}\)):** This is the fundamental example of a countably infinite set. \(|\mathbb{N}| = \aleph_0\).
    -   **The Set of Integers (\(\mathbb{Z}\)):** This set is also countably infinite. We can list its elements like this: \(0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, \dots\). This ensures every integer appears exactly once in the list. So, \(|\mathbb{Z}| = \aleph_0\).
    -   **The Set of Rational Numbers (\(\mathbb{Q}\)):** Surprisingly, the set of all fractions is also countably infinite. Although they seem much more "dense" than integers, it can be proven that they can be systematically listed without missing any. So, \(|\mathbb{Q}| = \aleph_0\).

#### Uncountable Sets

An infinite set that is not countable is called an **uncountable set** (or **uncountably infinite**). It is impossible to list all the elements of an uncountable set in a sequence. These sets are "larger" in size than countably infinite sets.

!!! warning "Uncountable Sets are 'Bigger' Infinities"
    The existence of uncountable sets implies that there are different sizes of infinity. The cardinality of countably infinite sets (\(\aleph_0\)) is the "smallest" infinity.

!!! example "Uncountable Sets"
    -   **The Set of Real Numbers (\(\mathbb{R}\)):** This is the most common example of an uncountable set. The famous **Cantor's diagonalization argument** proves that the real numbers between 0 and 1 alone cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with \(\mathbb{N}\). Therefore, the set of all real numbers is uncountable. Its cardinality is denoted by \(c\) (for continuum) or \(\aleph_1\). We know that \(\aleph_0 < c\).
    -   **The Power Set of \(\mathbb{N}\):** The set of all subsets of the natural numbers, denoted \(P(\mathbb{N})\), is also uncountable.

## Operations on Sets and Venn Diagrams

### Universal Set (U)

Before diving into operations, it's crucial to understand the **Universal Set**, denoted by \(U\). The universal set is the set containing all possible elements under consideration for a particular problem. All other sets are considered subsets of the universal set.

-   **Example**: If we are discussing sets of vowels, the universal set could be \(U = \{a, e, i, o, u\}\). If we are discussing sets of single-digit numbers, \(U = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\).

### Venn Diagrams

A **Venn diagram** is a visual representation of the relationship between sets. It uses overlapping circles or other shapes to illustrate the logical relationships between two or more sets. The universal set is typically represented by a rectangle, and subsets are represented by circles within this rectangle.

</figure>


### Basic Set Operations

Let's consider two sets, \(A\) and \(B\), which are subsets of a universal set \(U\).

#### Union of Sets (âˆª)

The **union** of two sets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted by \(A \cup B\), is the set of all elements that are in set \(A\), or in set \(B\), or in both.

-   **Set-Builder Notation**: \(A \cup B = \{x \mid x \in A \lor x \in B\}\)
-   **Explanation**: It combines all unique elements from both sets.
-   **Example**:
    -   Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{3, 4, 5\}\).
    -   Then, \(A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).

##### Venn Diagram for Union
The union is represented by shading the entire area covered by both circles \(A\) and \(B\).

<figure markdown="span">
  ![](https://mathmonks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Set-Union.jpg)
</figure>

#### Intersection of Sets (âˆ©)

The **intersection** of two sets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted by \(A \cap B\), is the set of all elements that are common to both set \(A\) and set \(B\).

-   **Set-Builder Notation**: \(A \cap B = \{x \mid x \in A \land x \in B\}\)
-   **Explanation**: It includes only the elements that exist in both sets simultaneously.
-   **Example**:
    -   Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{3, 4, 5\}\).
    -   Then, \(A \cap B = \{3\}\).

If \(A \cap B = \emptyset\) (the empty set), then \(A\) and \(B\) are called **disjoint sets**.

##### Venn Diagram for Intersection
The intersection is represented by shading only the overlapping area of circles \(A\) and \(B\).


#### Difference of Sets (âˆ’ or \\)

The **difference** between two sets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted by \(A - B\) or \(A \setminus B\), is the set of all elements that are in set \(A\) but not in set \(B\).

-   **Set-Builder Notation**: \(A - B = \{x \mid x \in A \land x \notin B\}\)
-   **Explanation**: Start with set \(A\) and remove all elements that are also present in set \(B\). Note that \(A - B \neq B - A\) in general.
-   **Example**:
    -   Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{3, 4, 5\}\).
    -   Then, \(A - B = \{1, 2\}\).
    -   And, \(B - A = \{4, 5\}\).

##### Venn Diagram for Difference
The difference \(A - B\) is represented by shading the area of circle \(A\) that does not overlap with circle \(B\).


#### Complement of a Set (A' or Aá¶œ)

The **complement** of a set \(A\), denoted by \(A'\) or \(A^c\), is the set of all elements in the universal set \(U\) that are not in set \(A\).

-   **Set-Builder Notation**: \(A' = \{x \in U \mid x \notin A\}\)
-   **Explanation**: It's essentially \(U - A\).
-   **Example**:
    -   Let \(U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) and \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\).
    -   Then, \(A' = \{4, 5, 6\}\).

##### Venn Diagram for Complement
The complement of \(A\) is represented by shading the area inside the universal set's rectangle but outside the circle \(A\).


#### Symmetric Difference (Î” or âŠ•)

The **symmetric difference** of two sets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted by \(A \Delta B\), is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.

-   **Set-Builder Notation**: \(A \Delta B = \{x \mid (x \in A \land x \notin B) \lor (x \in B \land x \notin A)\}\)
-   **Relationship with other operations**:
    -   \(A \Delta B = (A - B) \cup (B - A)\)
    -   \(A \Delta B = (A \cup B) - (A \cap B)\)
-   **Example**:
    -   Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{3, 4, 5\}\).
    -   \(A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)
    -   \(A \cap B = \{3\}\)
    -   Then, \(A \Delta B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} - \{3\} = \{1, 2, 4, 5\}\).

##### Venn Diagram for Symmetric Difference
The symmetric difference is represented by shading all parts of circles \(A\) and \(B\) except for their overlapping intersection.


### Laws of Set Algebra

Just like algebra with numbers, set operations follow certain laws.

| Law | Union | Intersection |
|---|---|---|
| **Commutative Law** | \(A \cup B = B \cup A\) | \(A \cap B = B \cap A\) |
| **Associative Law** | \((A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)\) | \((A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)\) |
| **Distributive Law** | \(A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)\) | \(A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)\) |
| **Identity Law** | \(A \cup \emptyset = A\) | \(A \cap U = A\) |
| **Complement Law** | \(A \cup A' = U\) | \(A \cap A' = \emptyset\) |
| **Idempotent Law** | \(A \cup A = A\) | \(A \cap A = A\) |

#### De Morgan's Laws

De Morgan's laws are two fundamental rules that relate union, intersection, and complementation.

1.  **First Law**: The complement of the union of two sets is the intersection of their complements.
    -   \((A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'\)

2.  **Second Law**: The complement of the intersection of two sets is the union of their complements.
    -   \((A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'\)


## Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion

<iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szUTQRJU76Q" title="Ch9Pr4: Inclusion/Exclusion Principle" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The **Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (PIE)** is a fundamental counting technique in combinatorics. It provides a systematic way to find the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets and then compensating for the elements that have been counted multiple times.

The core idea is to **"include"** the sizes of the individual sets, then **"exclude"** the sizes of their pairwise intersections, then **"include"** the sizes of their three-way intersections, and so on, with alternating signs.

---

#### PIE for Two Sets

For two finite sets, \(A\) and \(B\), the number of elements in their union \(A \cup B\) is the sum of the number of elements in each set minus the number of elements in their intersection.

The formula is:

\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

-   \(|A|\): The cardinality (number of elements) of set A.
-   \(|B|\): The cardinality of set B.
-   \(|A \cap B|\): The cardinality of the intersection of A and B (elements common to both).

We subtract \(|A \cap B|\) because these elements were counted twice: once in \(|A|\) and once in \(|B|\).


!!! example "Example: Students and Subjects"
    In a class of 50 students, 30 students passed in Mathematics (\(M\)), 25 passed in Science (\(S\)), and 15 passed in both subjects. How many students passed in at least one of the two subjects?

    - Let \(M\) be the set of students who passed in Mathematics, so \(|M| = 30\).
    - Let \(S\) be the set of students who passed in Science, so \(|S| = 25\).
    - The set of students who passed in both is \(M \cap S\), so \(|M \cap S| = 15\).

    We want to find the number of students who passed in at least one subject, which is \(|M \cup S|\).

    Using the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion:
    \[ |M \cup S| = |M| + |S| - |M \cap S| \]
    \[ |M \cup S| = 30 + 25 - 15 = 40 \]
    Therefore, **40 students** passed in at least one of the two subjects.

---

#### PIE for Three Sets

For three finite sets, \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), the principle is extended. We add the sizes of the sets, subtract the sizes of all pairwise intersections, and finally add back the size of the three-way intersection.

The formula is:

\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|) + |A \cap B \cap C| \]

-   **Inclusion:** We first add \(|A|\), \(|B|\), and \(|C|\). This overcounts elements in the intersections.
-   **Exclusion:** We subtract \(|A \cap B|\), \(|A \cap C|\), and \(|B \cap C|\) to correct for the double-counting. However, this over-corrects for the elements in \(A \cap B \cap C\), which were initially counted three times and have now been subtracted three times.
-   **Inclusion:** We add back \(|A \cap B \cap C|\) to ensure these elements are counted exactly once.


---

#### The General Principle

The principle can be generalized to find the cardinality of the union of \(n\) finite sets, \(A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\).

The general formula is:

\[ |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n| = \sum_{1 \le i \le n} |A_i| - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le n} |A_i \cap A_j| + \sum_{1 \le i < j < k \le n} |A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - \dots + (-1)^{n-1} |A_1 \cap \dots \cap A_n| \]

In a more compact summation notation:

\[ |\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i| = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k-1} \sum_{1 \le i_1 < \dots < i_k \le n} |A_{i_1} \cap \dots \cap A_{i_k}| \]

!!! note "Complementary Form"
    Often, we are interested in finding the number of elements that are in **none** of the sets. If \(U\) is the universal set, this is given by \(|\overline{A_1} \cap \overline{A_2} \cap \dots \cap \overline{A_n}|\).
    By De Morgan's laws, this is equal to \(|\overline{A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n}|\).

    \[ |\overline{A_1} \cap \dots \cap \overline{A_n}| = |U| - |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n| \]

---

#### Applications of PIE

The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion has several important applications in combinatorics and number theory.

##### Counting Integers with Specific Properties

PIE is used to count the number of integers in a range that are divisible by a certain set of numbers.

!!! example "Example: Divisibility"
    How many positive integers not exceeding 1000 are divisible by 5, 7, or 11?

    - **Universal Set:** \(U = \{1, 2, \dots, 1000\}\), so \(|U|=1000\).
    - **Sets:**
        - Let \(A\) be the set of integers divisible by 5. \(|A| = \lfloor \frac{1000}{5} \rfloor = 200\).
        - Let \(B\) be the set of integers divisible by 7. \(|B| = \lfloor \frac{1000}{7} \rfloor = 142\).
        - Let \(C\) be the set of integers divisible by 11. \(|C| = \lfloor \frac{1000}{11} \rfloor = 90\).

    - **Pairwise Intersections (divisible by pairs of numbers):**
        - \(|A \cap B|\) (divisible by 5 and 7, i.e., 35): \( \lfloor \frac{1000}{35} \rfloor = 28\).
        - \(|A \cap C|\) (divisible by 5 and 11, i.e., 55): \( \lfloor \frac{1000}{55} \rfloor = 18\).
        - \(|B \cap C|\) (divisible by 7 and 11, i.e., 77): \( \lfloor \frac{1000}{77} \rfloor = 12\).

    - **Three-way Intersection (divisible by 5, 7, and 11, i.e., 385):**
        - \(|A \cap B \cap C|\): \( \lfloor \frac{1000}{385} \rfloor = 2\).

    - **Applying PIE:**

    \[ |A \cup B \cup C| = (|A| + |B| + |C|) - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|) + |A \cap B \cap C| \]

    \[ |A \cup B \cup C| = (200 + 142 + 90) - (28 + 18 + 12) + 2 \]

    \[ |A \cup B \cup C| = 432 - 58 + 2 = 376 \]

    So, **376 integers** not exceeding 1000 are divisible by 5, 7, or 11.

##### Derangements

A **derangement** is a permutation of the elements of a set such that no element appears in its original position. The number of derangements of \(n\) elements is denoted by \(D_n\) or \(!n\).

-   **Problem:** Find the number of derangements of \(n\) objects.
-   **Approach:** We find the total number of permutations (\(n!\)) and subtract the number of permutations where at least one element is in its correct place.

Let \(U\) be the set of all \(n!\) permutations. Let \(A_i\) be the set of permutations where the \(i\)-th element is in its original position. We want to find the number of permutations that are in none of these sets, i.e., \(|U| - |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n|\).

-   The size of \(A_i\) is \((n-1)!\) (fix element \(i\) and permute the other \(n-1\)). There are \(\binom{n}{1}\) such sets.
-   The size of \(A_i \cap A_j\) is \((n-2)!\). There are \(\binom{n}{2}\) such intersections.
-   The size of a \(k\)-wise intersection is \((n-k)!\). There are \(\binom{n}{k}\) such intersections.

Using PIE, the number of permutations with at least one fixed point is:

\[ |A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_n| = \binom{n}{1}(n-1)! - \binom{n}{2}(n-2)! + \dots + (-1)^{n-1}\binom{n}{n}(n-n)! \]

Simplifying \(\binom{n}{k}(n-k)! = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}(n-k)! = \frac{n!}{k!}\), we get:

\[ |A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_n| = \frac{n!}{1!} - \frac{n!}{2!} + \frac{n!}{3!} - \dots + (-1)^{n-1}\frac{n!}{n!} \]

The number of derangements \(D_n\) is:

\[ D_n = n! - |A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_n| \]

\[ D_n = n! - (\frac{n!}{1!} - \frac{n!}{2!} + \dots + (-1)^{n-1}\frac{n!}{n!}) \]

\[ D_n = n! \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \dots + \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \right) = n! \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \]

##### Number of Surjective (Onto) Functions

A function \(f: A \to B\) is **surjective** (or onto) if every element in the codomain \(B\) is an image of at least one element from the domain \(A\). PIE can be used to count the number of such functions.

-   **Problem:** Find the number of surjective functions from set \(A\) with \(m\) elements to set \(B\) with \(n\) elements, where \(m \ge n\).
-   **Approach:** Start with the total number of functions from \(A\) to \(B\), which is \(n^m\). Then, subtract the functions that are *not* surjective. A function is not surjective if at least one element in \(B\) is not in the image.

Let \(B = \{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n\}\). Let \(A_i\) be the set of functions where the element \(b_i \in B\) is *not* in the image of the function. We want to find the number of functions that are in none of these sets, which is \(n^m - |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n|\).

-   The size of \(A_i\): These are functions from \(A\) to \(B - \{b_i\}\). There are \((n-1)\) choices in the codomain for each of the \(m\) elements in the domain. So, \(|A_i| = (n-1)^m\).
-   The size of \(A_i \cap A_j\): These are functions that miss both \(b_i\) and \(b_j\). So, \(|A_i \cap A_j| = (n-2)^m\).
-   The size of a \(k\)-wise intersection is \((n-k)^m\).

The number of functions that are not surjective is \(|A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_n|\):

\[ \binom{n}{1}(n-1)^m - \binom{n}{2}(n-2)^m + \dots + (-1)^{n-1}\binom{n}{n}(n-n)^m \]

The number of surjective functions is:

\[ n^m - \left[ \binom{n}{1}(n-1)^m - \binom{n}{2}(n-2)^m + \dots \right] \]

This simplifies to the formula:

\[ \sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \binom{n}{k} (n-k)^m \]

## Multisets

A multiset is a modification of the concept of a set that, unlike a standard set, allows for multiple instances of each of its elements. The number of times an element appears in a multiset is called its **multiplicity**. Multisets are also sometimes called **bags**.

For example, \(\{1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3\}\) and \(\{a, b, b, c, d, d, d\}\) are multisets. In a standard set, these would be represented as \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(\{a, b, c, d\}\), respectively, as duplicates are not counted.

### Formal Definition

Formally, a multiset \(M\) can be defined as an ordered pair \((S, m)\), where \(S\) is the **underlying set** of distinct elements, and \(m\) is a **multiplicity function** \(m: S \to \mathbb{Z}^+\), which maps each element in \(S\) to a positive integer representing its multiplicity.

For the multiset \(M = \{a, a, b, c, c, c\}\):

-   The underlying set is \(S = \{a, b, c\}\).
-   The multiplicity function \(m\) is defined as:
    -   \(m(a) = 2\)
    -   \(m(b) = 1\)
    -   \(m(c) = 3\)

### Cardinality of a Multiset

The cardinality (or size) of a multiset is the total number of elements it contains, including repetitions. It is the sum of the multiplicities of all its distinct elements.

If \(M = (S, m)\) is a multiset, its cardinality, denoted as \(|M|\) or \(card(M)\), is calculated as:
\[ |M| = \sum_{x \in S} m(x) \]
**Example:**
For the multiset \(M = \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4\}\):

-   Underlying set \(S = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
-   Multiplicities are \(m(1)=2\), \(m(2)=1\), \(m(3)=3\), \(m(4)=1\).
-   The cardinality is \(|M| = 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7\).

### Submultisets

A multiset \(A\) is a submultiset of a multiset \(B\), denoted \(A \subseteq B\), if the multiplicity of each element in \(A\) is less than or equal to its multiplicity in \(B\).

Formally, let \(A = (S_A, m_A)\) and \(B = (S_B, m_B)\). Then \(A \subseteq B\) if and only if for every element \(x \in S_A\), \(x\) is also in \(S_B\) and \(m_A(x) \le m_B(x)\).

**Example:**
If \(A = \{a, a, b\}\) and \(B = \{a, a, a, b, c\}\), then \(A\) is a submultiset of \(B\) because:

-   \(m_A(a) = 2\) and \(m_B(a) = 3\), so \(2 \le 3\).
-   \(m_A(b) = 1\) and \(m_B(b) = 1\), so \(1 \le 1\).

### Operations on Multisets

Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two multisets. Let \(m_A(x)\) and \(m_B(x)\) be the multiplicities of an element \(x\) in \(A\) and \(B\) respectively. (If an element is not in a multiset, its multiplicity is 0).


#### Union

The **union** of two multisets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted \(A \cup B\), is a multiset where the multiplicity of an element is the **maximum** of its multiplicities in \(A\) and \(B\).
\[ m_{A \cup B}(x) = \max(m_A(x), m_B(x)) \]
**Example:**
Let \(A = \{1, 1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{1, 2, 2, 4\}\).

-   \(m_A(1) = 2\), \(m_B(1) = 1 \implies \max(2, 1) = 2\). Multiplicity of 1 is 2.
-   \(m_A(2) = 1\), \(m_B(2) = 2 \implies \max(1, 2) = 2\). Multiplicity of 2 is 2.
-   \(m_A(3) = 1\), \(m_B(3) = 0 \implies \max(1, 0) = 1\). Multiplicity of 3 is 1.
-   \(m_A(4) = 0\), \(m_B(4) = 1 \implies \max(0, 1) = 1\). Multiplicity of 4 is 1.

Therefore, \(A \cup B = \{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4\}\).

#### Intersection

The **intersection** of two multisets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted \(A \cap B\), is a multiset where the multiplicity of an element is the **minimum** of its multiplicities in \(A\) and \(B\).
\[ m_{A \cap B}(x) = \min(m_A(x), m_B(x)) \]
**Example:**
Let \(A = \{1, 1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{1, 2, 2, 4\}\).

-   \(m_A(1) = 2\), \(m_B(1) = 1 \implies \min(2, 1) = 1\). Multiplicity of 1 is 1.
-   \(m_A(2) = 1\), \(m_B(2) = 2 \implies \min(1, 2) = 1\). Multiplicity of 2 is 1.
-   \(m_A(3) = 1\), \(m_B(3) = 0 \implies \min(1, 0) = 0\). Multiplicity of 3 is 0.
-   \(m_A(4) = 0\), \(m_B(4) = 1 \implies \min(0, 1) = 0\). Multiplicity of 4 is 0.

Therefore, \(A \cap B = \{1, 2\}\).

#### Sum

The **sum** of two multisets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted \(A + B\) or \(A \uplus B\), is a multiset where the multiplicity of an element is the **sum** of its multiplicities in \(A\) and \(B\). This operation is also known as the disjoint union.
\[ m_{A+B}(x) = m_A(x) + m_B(x) \]
**Example:**
Let \(A = \{a, b, b\}\) and \(B = \{b, c\}\).

-   \(m_A(a) = 1\), \(m_B(a) = 0 \implies 1 + 0 = 1\). Multiplicity of \(a\) is 1.
-   \(m_A(b) = 2\), \(m_B(b) = 1 \implies 2 + 1 = 3\). Multiplicity of \(b\) is 3.
-   \(m_A(c) = 0\), \(m_B(c) = 1 \implies 0 + 1 = 1\). Multiplicity of \(c\) is 1.

Therefore, \(A + B = \{a, b, b, b, c\}\).

#### Difference

The **difference** of two multisets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted \(A - B\), is a multiset where the multiplicity of an element \(x\) in \(A - B\) is the multiplicity of \(x\) in \(A\) minus its multiplicity in \(B\), if the result is positive. Otherwise, the multiplicity is 0.
\[ m_{A-B}(x) = \max(0, m_A(x) - m_B(x)) \]
**Example:**
Let \(A = \{1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3\}\) and \(B = \{1, 1, 3, 4\}\).

-   For element 1: \(m_A(1) - m_B(1) = 3 - 2 = 1\).
-   For element 2: \(m_A(2) - m_B(2) = 1 - 0 = 1\).
-   For element 3: \(m_A(3) - m_B(3) = 2 - 1 = 1\).
-   For element 4: \(m_A(4) - m_B(4) = 0 - 1 = -1\). Since this is negative, the multiplicity is \(\max(0, -1) = 0\).

Therefore, \(A - B = \{1, 2, 3\}\).

### Applications of Multisets

Multisets are useful in various fields of mathematics and computer science.

-   **Prime Factorization:** The prime factorization of an integer is a multiset of prime numbers. For example, the factorization of 120 is \(2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1\), which corresponds to the multiset \(\{2, 2, 2, 3, 5\}\).
-   **Combinatorics:** Multisets are used in counting problems, particularly for calculating permutations and combinations where repetitions are allowed. The number of permutations of a multiset of size \(n\) is given by the multinomial coefficient.
-   **Computer Science:**
    -   In database systems, query results can often be multisets (bags) rather than sets, as duplicate rows might be returned.
    -   In data structures, a "bag" is an abstract data type that implements the multiset concept.
    -   Frequency analysis in text processing or data mining relies on counting occurrences, which is a multiset concept.
