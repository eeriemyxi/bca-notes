</figure>

* Why should I blame her that she fill my days
* With misery, or that she would of late
* Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
* Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
* Had they but courage equal to desire?
* What could have made her peaceful with a mind
* That nobleness made simple as a fire,
* With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
* That is not natural in an age like this,
* Being high and solitary and most stern?
* Why, what could she have done, being what she is?
* Was there another Troy for her to burn?

## Summary
The speaker starts by asking why he should blame a certain woman for making him personally miserable. He also asks why he should blame her for encouraging poor, uneducated men to use violence in a political uprising, essentially turning the poor against the rich and powerful. He notes that the uprising failed only because the men's courage did not match their desire for change.

The speaker then answers his own question. He says it was impossible for her to be peaceful because of her personality. He describes her mind as being noble but also intense and destructive, like a fire. He describes her beauty as being tense and dangerous, like a tightly pulled bow. He feels that this kind of serious, intense, and solitary person is old-fashioned and does not belong in the modern world.
e
He concludes that, given her nature, she had no other choice. He compares her to Helen of Troy, a famous beauty from mythology who caused the destruction of the great city of Troy. The speaker implies this woman has the same epic, destructive quality. Since there was no ancient, legendary city like Troy for her to destroy in modern times, she had to cause this smaller, political conflict instead. It was simply her destiny to cause destruction.
