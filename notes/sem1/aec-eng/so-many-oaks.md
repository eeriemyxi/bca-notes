* In this forest we stand among ancient trees.
* So many oaks. Holy. An evil witch would kill them.
* The windows of that house are so bright, so clean -
* Who lives there? A woman who lost five sons in the war.
* Birds have feathers but mammals have none.
* A pity because I would really like to fly.
* Human beings have eyes and ears
* but some are born blind or deaf.
* The flowers of a plum tree can be red or white.
* I have one of each in my garden.
* My hat is brown. My gloves are brown.
* A practical colour.

## Summary
In Sujata Bhatt's "So Many Oaks," the speaker stands in a forest, observing the world's random and often contradictory nature. The poem contrasts the ancient, enduring beauty of oak trees with the sharp, specific pain of human tragedy, such as a woman who lost five sons in the war.

The speaker's thoughts jump between the freedom of birds, the reality of human disability, and the simple beauty of flowers. It all concludes with a quiet, grounding observation about the speaker's own brown hat and gloves, calling the color "practical." Ultimately, the poem is a reflection on how **profound beauty and deep sorrow exist side-by-side**, and how people often cope by focusing on simple, everyday realities.

## Answers

1.  The poem is set in a forest.
2.  The poem mentions oak trees.
3.  The speaker says an "evil witch" would kill the trees.
4.  The woman in the house lost five sons in the war.
5.  Birds have feathers, which the speaker implies would allow her to fly.
6.  The flowers of a plum tree can be red or white.
7.  The speaker's hat and gloves are brown.
8.  Calling the oaks "Holy" suggests they are ancient, sacred, and possess an enduring spiritual quality that contrasts with human fragility.
9.  The contrast highlights the indifference of timeless nature to specific, acute human suffering. The oaks stand long before and after the war.
10.  The "bright, so clean" windows could symbolize a brave attempt to maintain normalcy and order in the face of unimaginable grief.
11.  The connecting theme is the fragmented and random nature of existence, where profound beauty, deep tragedy, and mundane facts all coexist.
12.  It brings the poem to a sudden, quiet, and resigned conclusion, suggesting a retreat from overwhelming emotion into the safety of the mundane.
13.  The desire "to fly" expresses a yearning for freedom and escape from the limitations and sorrows of human life.
14.  The shift from the vast forest to personal items grounds the poem in the individual's small reality, highlighting how one person navigates a world of big, impersonal forces.
15.  It adds to the theme that life is inherently imperfect and arbitrary; suffering and limitations are presented as simple facts of existence, just like eye color or the color of flowers.
16.  The primary juxtaposition is between the enduring, holy oaks and the tragic, transient life of the woman who lost her sons. Another is between the desire to fly and the practical, earthbound brown gloves.
17.  The free verse structure mimics the natural, disjointed flow of human thought and observation, making the poem feel intimate and immediate.
18.  The ancient oaks symbolize endurance, stability, and the continuity of the natural world, acting as silent witnesses to the fleeting tragedies of human history.
19.  The tone shifts from awe ("Holy"), to pathos (the woman's loss), to wistfulness (desire to fly), and finally settles into a flat, pragmatic resignation ("A practical colour").
20.  The title emphasizes the overwhelming, enduring presence of nature. Despite the poem's focus on human suffering and limitation, the oaks are the dominant, framing reality.
21.  The poem suggests that humanity and nature exist on separate planes. Nature is a powerful, indifferent backdrop to the drama of human life, offering no answers to its suffering.
22.  The ending is best described as resigned. The turn to practicality is not a solution or a sign of hope, but an acceptance of the need to ground oneself in simple reality to endure.
23.  The poem explores **loss** through the dead sons and disabilities, **endurance** through the ancient oaks and the grieving mother, and uses **observation** as the method by which the speaker processes these conflicting realities.
24.  The simple, almost child-like voice makes the poem's profound observations feel more direct and powerful. It presents the harsh realities of life as plain, undeniable facts.
25.  The central conflict is between the human mind's search for meaning, beauty, and escape, and the stark, often painful or mundane reality it is forced to observe.
