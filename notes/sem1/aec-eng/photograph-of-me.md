- It was taken some time ago. At first it seems to be a smeared print: blurred lines and grey flecks blended with the paper;
- then, as you scan it, you see in the left-hand corner a thing that is like a branch: part of a tree (balsam or spruce) emerging and, to the right, halfway up what ought to be a gentle slope, a small frame house.
- In the background there is a lake, and beyond that, some low hills.
- (The photograph was taken the day after I drowned.
- I am in the lake, in the centre of the picture, just under the surface.
- It is difficult to say where precisely, or to say how large or small I am: the effect of water on light is a distortion
- but if you look long enough, eventually you will be able to see me.)

## Summary
The poem describes an old, blurry, and faded photograph. At first glance, the picture seems to be just a smeared, grey landscape. But as you study it, you start to see details: a tree branch on one side, a small house on a slope, and a lake with low hills behind it.

The speaker of the poem then reveals a shocking fact: the photo was taken the day after she drowned. The speaker is actually the main subject of the picture, but she is hidden. She is in the lake, in the very center, lying just under the surface.

She explains that it is difficult to see her exact location or size because the water distorts her image, just as water makes things look wavy or bent. The poem suggests that the speaker is an unseen or ignored presence. What looks like a simple, empty landscape is actually a record of her death and her hidden body.

The poem ends by speaking directly to the viewer. It says that if you look at the photo long enough and with real effort, you will eventually be able to see her, implying that seeing the truth requires time and careful attention.

## Questions
1.  What is the speaker's initial description of the photograph's quality?
2.  What are the first distinct objects the speaker points out as the viewer's eyes adjust to the photo?
3.  What natural landscape features are described as being in the background of the photograph?
4.  When does the speaker reveal the photograph was taken?
5.  What shocking personal event does the speaker connect to the timing of the photograph?
6.  Where in the photograph does the speaker claim to be located?
7.  Why, according to the speaker, is it difficult to see her "precisely"?
8.  What is the "distortion" mentioned in the poem, and what is its literal cause?
9.  What condition does the speaker give for the viewer to "eventually" be able to see her?
10. Analyze the shift in tone that occurs at the parenthetical stanza (lines 16-27).
11. Discuss the significance of the photograph being "smeared" and "blurred." What could this symbolize beyond a poor-quality print?
12. How does the poem challenge the idea of photographs as objective, truthful records of reality?
13. What is the effect of the speaker calmly guiding the viewer through the landscape *before* revealing the tragedy?
14. Explain the "effect of water on light" as a metaphor. What else might be distorted besides the speaker's physical image?
15. Who is the "you" the speaker is addressing, and what role does this "you" play in the poem's meaning?
16. Explore the theme of visibility versus invisibility as it relates to the speaker.
17. What is the mood of the poem, and how does Atwood's language create it?
18. Why is it significant that the speaker is "just under the surface" and not deep at the bottom?
19. How does the poem use the simple description of a landscape to explore deeper themes of death, memory, and hidden truths?
20. Discuss the use of parentheses. Why might the poem's most crucial information be enclosed in them?
21. What might the "small frame house" on the slope represent or symbolize in the context of the poem?
22. Analyze the power dynamic between the speaker (who knows the truth) and the viewer (who must search for it).
23. How does the poem relate to the idea of a "haunting" or an unseen presence?
24. What might the poem be suggesting about the nature of truth and the effort required to find it?
25. Consider the poem as a commentary on the overlooked or suppressed stories, particularly those of women. How does the speaker's "drowning" function in this interpretation?

## Answers
1. It seems to be a smeared print with blurred lines and grey flecks.

5. Her own death by drowning.
6. She is in the lake, in the centre of the picture, just under the surface.
7. Because the effect of water on light causes distortion.
