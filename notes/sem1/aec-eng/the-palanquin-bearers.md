* Lightly, O lightly we bear her along,
* She sways like a flower in the wind of our song;
* She skims like a bird on the foam of a stream,
* She floats like a laugh from the lips of a dream.
* Gaily, O gaily we glide and we sing,
* We bear her along like a pearl on a string.
* Softly, O softly we bear her along,
* She hangs like a star in the dew of our song;
* She springs like a beam on the brow of the tide,
* She falls like a tear from the eyes of a bride.
* Lightly, O lightly we glide and we sing,
* We bear her along like a pearl on a string.

## Summary
This poem is about palki (palanquin) bearers who are carrying a dulhan (bride) in her doli.

They are very happy and singing a geet (song) as they walk. They say the bride is very light and delicate. They are carrying her very softly and gently (naram se).

In their song, they say she is beautiful and moves gently, just like a phool (flower) in the wind or a bird on a river. They feel she is very precious, like a moti (pearl) on a necklace.

The song has mixed feelings. It is happy, but it also mentions a "tear from the eyes of a bride." This shows that the dulhan feels both khushi (happiness) for her new life and a little sadness for leaving her family's home.
